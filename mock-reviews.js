Breakfast was included in the price and it had a large offer. It's located just accross the street from the madison square garden. Only 8 min to Times Square. So a great location!"

She was professional, courteous and very helpful and the upgrade was a big help to our family of 6. Then upon checking out we had Maria A. and again, she went two steps above and beyond to help us. She went over our bill in detail, she took our luggage into a holding room (without the fee of 5.00 per bag) and she helped direct us to a few sites we wanted to see prior to leaving NYC in a few hours. We met all kinds of service folks while visiting NY but these two were the best. Then add the house staff...super courteous and helpful. I would recommend the Hotel Pennsylvania to anyone traveling to NY as the location was great for sight-seeing."

The staff very polite. I stayed there one week. I`ll back in Pennsylvania my next visit in NY. In my opinion, it`s best choise in Manhetten and low price."

We waited less than 30 min to check in. Maria B at the front desk was so aaaaaamazing she made me cry!! From the moment she greeted my family to the moment she gave us our room key, she made us feel welcomed in this pretty intimidating town. Our room is beautiful and spacious that my kiddo even yelled it out! Thank you so much Maria for making our first day great!"

I had a very pleasant experience with Christine and George who work at the crew desk. Both of the correspondents are very helpful, very cheerful, and always willing to help and cheer for you despite the fact that they're busy helping various crew members all the time. They looked after both the airline and amtrak crew. Very commendable effort."

We always request the same room (sentimental reasons) and they always try to accommodate our request. The hotel is dated.. but that is part of the charm...."

All staff really helpful and very polite. The rooms were basic but clean. The beds were made daily. For the price you cannot..."

Yes i admit the hotel decor in the rooms is a little tired in places but it is always clean, fresh and the staff very helpful and friendly. It does at times have long check in queues but they do open many desks to cope with the quantity of people so the wait is not too long. If you are looking for best quality in New York, you need to pay the highest of prices, i believe this Hotel is good value for money. Perfectly situated for site seeing and within walking distance of everything that i want to see. great place to stay"

Has no amenities or room service but with this location who was ts to stay in their rooms? Same staff since years which is a good thing and now has wifi. Has a very popular dog show once a year. That's the period to avoid (I like dogs) as the place gets messy. I wish they upgrade stuff for the price they charge."

I had a beautiful room in one of the upgraded Penn category and loved it. I sure hope they do the rest of the hotel like this. These people really go above and beyond to make your stay memorable and enjoyable. I'll be back real soon thanks Pennsylvania team!"
