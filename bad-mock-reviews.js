		"text": "Stayed for 4 nights back in April. Waited over an hour in the queue to check in. Outside and reception looked lovely but as soon as you check to your room it's awful! Room was dark, old, tired and smelly, with a view to the roof full of empty cans, bottles and rubbish. Bathroom was dirty, spider welcomed us on the arrival too. No breakfast/cafe room in that big hotel was a disappointment, but there's plenty of places you can eat around the hotel. The only plus side was location, if you looking for somewhere just to sleep and have shower then it's perfect as it is right in the middle of manhattan. Not quite worth the price tho"

The lift staff were very helpful when we had to put a bag in the bag hold on the lower ground and we got us some labels for us without us going in the massive line to get them"

		"text": "My boyfriend and I only stayed here for 2 nights, and we're very surprised at how awful the service was. We only had one warm encounter with a front desk person, otherwise, everyone was rude. A housekeeper yelled at us for not checking out at 11 AM, even though we had a later check out time of 1 PM. AND the only reason we got a later check out was due to the nice front desk man who knew we were waiting in line at 11:30 PM for an hour due to only 1 (and after 30 min 2-3) front desk person working. I hear there are newer rooms, but the one we got had the wrong remote, had a rusty color coming from the spout of the shower, and looked kind of run down. We did not receive the room we wanted, which was a room with one double bed. Just overall made our trip way more stressful, especially being tourists unfamiliar with the area. On a positive note, the location was great. Everything was so close by. We were easily able to take a break from sight seeing to come back and shower/ nap before heading out again. This is definitely a place to stay if you want to be in a central location and are on a budget."

		"text": "I booked a room here because I was in NY for one night, and was looking for proximity to Penn Station, and a good price. I got both of those. Check in was horrendous, I tried three times, at different hours. The line was extraordinary, every time. The bell hop service was abysmal, no one could help me or show me how to check a bag. I finally had to demand to see a manager, then was charged $5.00 and sent to the basement to check it. I finally checked in at 2 AM, no line. the room was fine-clean and comfortable. The next morning I had to wait through seven elevators before I could make it to the lobby. SEVEN. They were all filled to bursting. Look, this hotel obviously attracts tourists and does a great business. My warning is for the business traveler- you will be unable to check in, and you are likely to miss any meetings. The New Yorker on 8th avenue is a much safer bet. I hope to never set foot in this one again."

		"text": "A friend and I stayed at the Pennsylvania in April for a concert at Madison Square Garden which is right across the street on 7th avenue. We upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite....only to discover that the toilet was leaking all over the bathroom floor in one of the baths. A plumber came but could not fix the problem. Meanwhile we asked about room service....none. How about dinner at the hotel restaurant...there wasn't one (there was a tavern in the same building). For a convenient stop right next to the Garden or Penn Station this can't be beat....too bad the historical hotel is in such a bad state. There was dust everywhere....perhaps because the hotel is being renovated. Hope so."

		"text": "This is a very old building with a new lobby. The rooms are basic, almost spartan. Internet is $20 a day. They could not check us in one hour earlier. 'the rooms are not ready'. But if we paid $50, then we could. The old doors have a plaque saying they are historic. They should put one on the AC as well. The carpet and the bathrooms were barely clean. This employee at the lobby, in charge of handing out access cards for the bathroom, THREW one across his desk at my wife when asked for one. We would have complained but the people at the reception desk were not very friendly either. Do not recommend. We are not going back."

		"text": "Given a room which was extremely noisy, dirty and had lifted enamel on rusty bath which was a hazard. Transferred to new room after complaining but why give that room out in the first place! Old decor can be tolerated if clean and if customer service good. Premises were very old tired and dirty in appearance. Staff were rude and unhelpful. Room was not serviced on one night. Don't recommend this place at all."

		"text": "I was tempted to save both me and the reader so much time by simply writing, 'do not stay here' but I will make the effort to explain why since your needs may be met if you really want to be on the doorstep of Madison Square Gardens or steps away from Macy's. Service is spotty in the least and bad for the most part. If you do get any help the staff make it seem they are doing you a favour or doing so behind the boss's back. All highly unlikely. I grew tired of what I called begging for what was standard and in no way beyond the norm. Facecloths were a rarity and we would arrive back in our room after the cupboard was locked. That is one tale from staff on the desk and also highly unlikely, I thought. My sheets were not changed daily. Given how dirty the streets in the area are that was not a good feeling when I would finally get to bed. All this is going on in a hotel that has what my husband calls the dirt of the ages in the corners, the carpets and the window sills. It may be easier to make a list of the general state of the room; scoffed walls, strange smears, hair clotted in the air conditioner dials, brown streak down the outside of the toiler bowl, corners filled with crusted dirt, dust on the bed board, lamps, oh just everywhere. Just give the room a good cleaning for heavens sake. There was a fuss over charges and although we were told we had to wait for three rooms on our floor and paid $40.00 to get into one early there was no sign of cleaning staff working on the rooms we would finally get at 3. Just give them out first come first served but of course that might cut into the $5.00 per bag charge for storing luggage. We were nickled and dimed at every turn. It was a carnival. The lobby is always a madhouse of people in lines, on every seat available and trying to save them for their shopping friends and piles of luggage. Lobbies should be cool and inviting and have some class. This one is like a steerage crossing filled with frustration and anger. Guests wander from one desk to another desperate for service and the so called manager who handles problems deals with cranky, unhappy people in the midst of all this. You relaxed yet.... I could probably go on but it has left a bad taste in my mouth and this is one of the reasons I will never visit New York again."

		"text": "The location is most, if not all, that this hotel has to offer. For that I will award the hotel one additional star. The room that was assigned to us was very small, dark and in need of a complete makeover. The mattresses offered little support and the bed was made with an old blanket, several power outlets were loosely attached to the walls, the alarm clock spontaneously fell apart and there were unidentified stains in the carpet. We thought the bathtub looked too grim to take a bath and chose to only use the shower. The water would go from scolding hot to cold and back. There was an endless list of issues during our stay. My name would not be linked to the room, we have had six or seven key cards broken, we had booked internet access for three devices but we were given internet access for only two devices, the code for internet access would expire and there was a balance on our hotel bill despite having pre-paid everything months ago. Some of the staff at the front desk were friendly and funny, others were rude and completely uninterested. Most of the aforementioned issues were resolved, but always with much too much effort from our side. I realize that Manhattan is an expensive location, but I would have expected a bit more for roughly 200 Euro per night."

		"text": "This hotel is in the BEST spot!!! Central to everything! Unfortunately, that is the only thing that is going for it. It seems like once you have paid then thats all they care about. Check-in took almost 40 min in the line, when we get to the front the lady (who i never once saw smile) informed us it was a $40 fee to get the room (which was ready) because we had arrived before 3pm. We paid the $40 as we didnt want to wait again in the line. The room was big, 2 single beds, each had one flimsy pillow. (i like to sleep with 2). I rang to request for another pillow, and they said they would bring one but it never arrived. The next day i rang again, finally got my pillow after waiting an hour. The paint in the ceilings is peeling off, some of the tiles had hairs on them, the beds were not comfortable. The showers are very hard to turn off and the water still runs, the windows were too stiff to open. I got a 'non smoking room' which smelt of smoke. Even had an ashtray.The rooms were fairly quiet. We had to book an extra 2 nights as we extended our holiday so got moved to a different room. The check in lady (same as before) told us she needed our copy of the receipt for the $100 deposit to show accounting. Not sure why she is asking for something she gave us to keep hold of. She wasnt very nice at all. The whole feel of this hotel is that they just want your money and they don't actually care about their guests. The checkout process is not well explained, (guests didnt realise they could use the express checkout box so many were lining up wasting time.) This hotel has so much potential to be great but the only thing it has going for it is its location. If you dont mind staying in a hostel style accomodation then go ahead and book. Don't expect friendly service from the staff they all look miserable."

However, the room we stayed in was awful. Old worn out furniture, mold, wasn't clean. Not to mention we had 3 'mini rooms' coming off ours. There were doors on every wall that opened out into empty rooms that were dark and cold."

On our arrival the queue to check in at least 20 people there were only two staff on the reception we were in line for 11/2 hours. The whole hotel is in need of refurbishment especially the bathrooms."

		"text": "Location couldn't be better but as far as hotel is concerned, it's not good. Avoid 3rd floor, maybe rest are just as bad, really needs a refit and if not, at least a good clean. If it was me, I'd knock it down and start again. I didn't dare take my socks of and touch the carpet. Our friends in another room also had their cases broken into and had $30 taken. Complained to security but not had response yet. One plus point over location was coffee shop in reception, cheap and good. Even though it's really bad it's still very busy, so maybe location is all people want"

		"text": "Tried one of those bargain sites on line to get a deal. Well I guess with NYC prices you definitely get what you pay for. $296/ night. The lobby looked promising enough ..... That's where it ended. Got to our room ..... Three twins no comforters, bare box spring mattresses. I've seen nicer in third world countries. Strong smell of bleach. Bathroom had a thick layer of dust on the molding. Paint and plaster peeling. Paint dropped on to floor and left that way. Heat not working. Corner room with two windows, would have been a plus if you could actually see out of them. They haven't been cleaned in some time. At least the bed was fairly comfortable after you get past the bleach smell. Computer room was a joke for printing tickets. It kept saying internet connection lost. The location, across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden was good. Other than that..... Not so much."

				+ "Pros:"
				+ "- great location, in close proximity to all NYC attractions"
				+ "- easy connection to the airport via public transportation (1 - 1.5 hr by bus, stop is across the street)"
				+ "- great potential if they do proper renovation and change management"
				+ "- the room had great TV and deposit box. "
				+ "- cheaper than other hotels nearby."

				+ "Cons:"
				+ "- absence of control and proper procedures. Just two examples: "
				+ "1) upon my arrival I checked in I arrived in the room which was not cleaned and in very poor condition (see photos 1...3). I came back to the reception and they changed the room, giving apologies (rest of photos)."
				+ "2) in my second room windows were very dirty, and the shower in bathroom was leaking during all days of my stay. I intentionally didn't call reception, hoping somebody will check, report and repair it. Not at all."
				+ "- no cafe or restaurant in the hotel. They gave me breakfast vouchers to visit R-Cafe across the street, which was good enough, but it is not in the hotel, and has very different style"
				+ "- Wi-Fi in the room is not free and is very expensive (I bought SIM card for the iPad and used 3G without problem). "
				+ "- sometimes the queue to the reception is very long and slow (see photo) - but not always."
